# CPU-Models

[Davis-In-Order (DINO) CPU](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20)

Goals:
- Learn how to implement a control and data path in a single cycle CPU.
- Learn how different RISC-V instructions interact in the control and data path of a single cycle CPU.
- Learn how to implement a pipelined CPU.
- Learn what information must be stored in pipeline registers.
- Learn which combinations of instructions cause hazards, and which can be overcome with forwarding.
- Learn how to handle the complexity of a real memory system.
- Evaluate different CPU designs.
- Evaluate trade-offs between different designs.
- Explore different implementation of matrix multiplication.
- Experiment with different memory access patterns and parallelism to find the best implementation on modern processors.

Completed Builds:

- Single-Cycle RISC-V CPU, along with all the different types of instructions
- Pipelined RISC-V CPU design with two different branch predictors
